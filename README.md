#Pep Retail-Sales

## Introduction

Pep is a growing clothing retailer focused on affordable fashion for diverse age groups. The company recently hired a new Data Strategy Manager to drive digital transformation and improve customer experience through data-driven decisions.

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the company's retail sales using SQL and Looker Studio to understand customer spending patterns, top-selling product categories, age group contributions, and overall revenue performance.

## Problem Statement

Over the past few quarters, Pep has experienced stagnant growth despite launching new product lines and expanding store locations.

Management struggled to identify which customer segments drive the most revenue and which products perform best across seasons. Without clear insights, marketing campaigns were misaligned, and inventory planning became inefficient—leading to overstocking on slow-moving items and missed opportunities on high-demand products.

To turn things around, the company brought in a Data Strategy Manager to evaluate customer trends, sales breakdowns, and performance drivers, with a focus on improving decision-making and optimizing operations.

## Aim

To evaluate Pep’s retail performance and generate actionable insights that will support smarter marketing, inventory control, and sales strategy.

## Objectives

Analyze sales data to identify revenue trends by product category, age group, and spending behavior.

Build an interactive dashboard to track customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

Deliver insights that help optimize pricing, promotions, and product focus.

## Tools Used

Snowflake – for writing SQL queries and cleaning raw transactional data.

Google Looker Studio – for dashboard creation and visual storytelling.
